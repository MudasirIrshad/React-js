2. Fill out the form fields: Email, Password, Address, City, and ZIP Code.

3. Click the "Sign in" button to submit the form.

4. The data you entered will be shown in a table under the form.

## Customization

You can customize this component as needed:

- Add form validation for data accuracy.
- Adjust the style by editing the CSS in `form.css`.
